## Development

Node.js is required.

To use Google API functionality, a client ID/secret is required; see Step 1 [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs).
Download the `credentials.json` file it provides, and place the file in the project root. DO NOT commit this file, or share it, etc, as it provides various access permissions to the Google account which was used to create it. Similarly, `token.json` (which the login process generates) should be kept private.
