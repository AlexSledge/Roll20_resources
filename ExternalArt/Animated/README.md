Files for use with Roll20 Enhancement Suite's new animated background.

As time allows there will listings for hosting for various animated background files, their 'theme' and content.

There are a couple key places to find animated battlemaps; the animated backgrounds should be of `.webm` video type.

In this directory you will find a few examples of those and a text file currated with links to other examples.
