## Usage

The files in the `dist` directory are automatically generated from the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NJeO5HJhUwVkBVzN3Mg7-W7adJ9FE9C9f_oT93n4M8/edit#gid=66737284), using the `_node/ArtGrab.js` script.

To run the script, follow the setup guide in the project's README.md, and then `$ npm run art` from the project root.

#### Options
To skip thumbnail generation: `$ npm run art -- --nothumbs`

To do a "dry run" (no files will be saved): `$ npm run art -- --dry`
